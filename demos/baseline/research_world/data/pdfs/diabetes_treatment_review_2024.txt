# Comprehensive Review: Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Landscape 2024

## Executive Summary

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects approximately 537 million adults globally,
with prevalence expected to rise to 783 million by 2045. This review examines
current treatment approaches, emerging therapies, and evidence-based recommendations.

## First-Line Therapy: Metformin

Metformin remains the cornerstone of T2DM management:
- Mechanism: Reduces hepatic glucose production via AMPK activation
- Efficacy: HbA1c reduction of 1.0-1.5%
- Benefits: Weight neutral, cardiovascular protection, low cost
- Limitations: GI side effects, contraindicated in severe renal impairment

## Second-Line Options

### SGLT2 Inhibitors (Empagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Canagliflozin)
- Mechanism: Block renal glucose reabsorption
- HbA1c reduction: 0.5-1.0%
- Additional benefits:
  * Cardiovascular risk reduction (EMPA-REG: 38% CV death reduction)
  * Heart failure hospitalization reduction (35%)
  * Renal protection (CREDENCE trial)
- Weight loss: 2-3 kg average
- Risks: Genital infections, DKA (rare)

### GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Semaglutide, Liraglutide, Dulaglutide)
- Mechanism: Enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion
- HbA1c reduction: 1.0-1.8%
- Weight loss: Up to 15% with semaglutide 2.4mg
- Cardiovascular benefits: LEADER showed 13% MACE reduction
- Side effects: Nausea, vomiting (usually transient)

### DPP-4 Inhibitors (Sitagliptin, Linagliptin)
- Mechanism: Prevent incretin degradation
- HbA1c reduction: 0.5-0.8%
- Weight neutral
- Well tolerated but modest efficacy

## Emerging Therapies

### Tirzepatide (Dual GIP/GLP-1 Agonist)
- SURPASS trials: Up to 2.4% HbA1c reduction
- Weight loss: Up to 22.5%
- Approved for T2DM, obesity indication pending

### Oral Semaglutide
- First oral GLP-1 agonist
- Similar efficacy to injectable formulation
- Requires specific administration protocol

## Treatment Algorithm

1. Lifestyle modification + Metformin (first-line)
2. Add SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA based on:
   - Cardiovascular disease: Prefer agents with proven CV benefit
   - Heart failure: SGLT2 inhibitor preferred
   - CKD: SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA with renal benefit
   - Obesity: GLP-1 RA preferred
3. Consider combination therapy for HbA1c >9%
4. Insulin when other agents insufficient

## Key Clinical Trials Summary

| Trial | Drug | Primary Outcome | Result |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------|
| EMPA-REG | Empagliflozin | CV death, MI, stroke | 14% reduction |
| LEADER | Liraglutide | MACE | 13% reduction |
| SUSTAIN-6 | Semaglutide | MACE | 26% reduction |
| CREDENCE | Canagliflozin | Renal composite | 30% reduction |
| SURPASS-2 | Tirzepatide | HbA1c | Superior to semaglutide |

## Conclusions

Modern T2DM management has evolved beyond glucose control to include
cardiovascular and renal protection. Individualized therapy selection
based on comorbidities, patient preferences, and treatment goals is essential.
