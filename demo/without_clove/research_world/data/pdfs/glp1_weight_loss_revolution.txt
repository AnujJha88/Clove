# GLP-1 Receptor Agonists: The Weight Loss Revolution

## Overview

GLP-1 receptor agonists have transformed obesity treatment, with semaglutide
achieving unprecedented weight loss in clinical trials.

## Mechanism of Weight Loss

### Central Effects
- Hypothalamic appetite suppression
- Reduced food reward signaling
- Increased satiety
- Delayed gastric emptying

### Peripheral Effects
- Improved insulin sensitivity
- Reduced hepatic lipogenesis
- Possible increased energy expenditure

## Clinical Evidence for Weight Loss

### STEP Trials (Semaglutide 2.4mg for Obesity)

**STEP 1 (N=1,961)**
- Population: Obesity without diabetes
- Result: 14.9% weight loss vs 2.4% placebo
- 86% achieved ≥5% weight loss
- 32% achieved ≥20% weight loss

**STEP 2 (N=1,210)**
- Population: Obesity with T2DM
- Result: 9.6% weight loss vs 3.4% placebo
- HbA1c reduction: 1.6%

**STEP 3 (N=611)**
- Population: Obesity + intensive behavioral therapy
- Result: 16.0% weight loss vs 5.7% placebo

**STEP 4 (N=902)**
- Design: Withdrawal study
- Result: Continued treatment maintained loss
- Weight regain of ~7% after stopping

### SURMOUNT Trials (Tirzepatide for Obesity)

**SURMOUNT-1 (N=2,539)**
- Population: Obesity without diabetes
- Results by dose:
  * 5mg: 15.0% weight loss
  * 10mg: 19.5% weight loss
  * 15mg: 20.9% weight loss
- 57% achieved ≥20% weight loss at highest dose

### Head-to-Head Comparison

**SURPASS-2**
- Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide 1mg in T2DM
- Weight loss: Tirzepatide superior at all doses
- HbA1c: Tirzepatide superior

## Cardiovascular Outcomes

### SELECT Trial (2023)
- Semaglutide 2.4mg in obesity WITHOUT diabetes
- N = 17,604 with overweight/obesity and CVD
- Primary outcome: 20% MACE reduction
- Paradigm shift: CV benefit independent of diabetes

## Practical Considerations

### Dosing
- Start low, titrate slowly to minimize GI effects
- Semaglutide: 0.25mg weekly → 2.4mg over 16-20 weeks
- Tirzepatide: 2.5mg weekly → 15mg over 20 weeks

### Patient Selection
- BMI ≥30, or ≥27 with comorbidity
- Motivated for lifestyle changes
- No contraindications (MTC history, MEN2)

### Managing Side Effects
- Nausea: Most common, usually transient
- Advise smaller meals, avoid high-fat foods
- Slow titration if persistent

### Duration of Therapy
- Weight regain after discontinuation
- Likely long-term/indefinite treatment needed
- Insurance coverage remains barrier

## Future Directions

1. Oral formulations (oral semaglutide available)
2. Triple agonists (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon)
3. Combination approaches
4. Earlier intervention in obesity
5. Addressing weight maintenance

## Summary

GLP-1 RAs represent a paradigm shift in obesity treatment, achieving
weight loss approaching bariatric surgery with proven cardiovascular
benefits. Tirzepatide may offer even greater efficacy.
