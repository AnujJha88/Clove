# SGLT2 Inhibitors: Mechanisms and Clinical Evidence

## Pharmacology

### Mechanism of Action
SGLT2 (Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2) is responsible for ~90% of renal
glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule. SGLT2 inhibitors block this
transporter, causing glucosuria of 70-80g/day.

### Pharmacokinetics
- Empagliflozin: t1/2 = 12.4h, 86% protein bound
- Dapagliflozin: t1/2 = 12.9h, 91% protein bound
- Canagliflozin: t1/2 = 10.6-13.1h, 99% protein bound

## Cardiovascular Mechanisms

Beyond glucose lowering, SGLT2i provide CV benefits through:

1. Hemodynamic Effects
   - Reduced preload (osmotic diuresis)
   - Reduced afterload (decreased arterial stiffness)
   - Blood pressure reduction (3-5 mmHg systolic)

2. Metabolic Effects
   - Shift from glucose to fatty acid/ketone oxidation
   - Increased ketone bodies (efficient myocardial fuel)
   - Reduced lipotoxicity

3. Direct Cardiac Effects
   - Improved myocardial energetics
   - Reduced oxidative stress
   - Anti-inflammatory effects

## Renal Protection Mechanisms

1. Reduced intraglomerular pressure
   - Restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback
   - Afferent arteriole vasoconstriction

2. Reduced hyperfiltration
   - Decreased single-nephron GFR
   - Protection against progressive nephron loss

3. Metabolic effects
   - Reduced renal oxygen consumption
   - Decreased inflammation and fibrosis

## Major Clinical Trials

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME (2015)
- N = 7,020 with T2DM and established CVD
- Empagliflozin vs placebo
- Primary: 14% MACE reduction (HR 0.86)
- CV death: 38% reduction
- HF hospitalization: 35% reduction

### CANVAS Program (2017)
- N = 10,142 with T2DM and high CV risk
- Canagliflozin vs placebo
- Primary: 14% MACE reduction (HR 0.86)
- Signal for increased amputation (addressed)

### DECLARE-TIMI 58 (2019)
- N = 17,160 with T2DM (broader population)
- Dapagliflozin vs placebo
- CV death/HF hospitalization: 17% reduction
- Established CVD and risk factor subgroups benefited

### DAPA-HF (2019)
- N = 4,744 with HFrEF (with or without diabetes)
- Dapagliflozin vs placebo
- Primary: 26% reduction in CV death/HF worsening
- Benefit in non-diabetic patients established

### CREDENCE (2019)
- N = 4,401 with T2DM and CKD
- Canagliflozin vs placebo
- Primary renal outcome: 30% reduction
- Stopped early for efficacy

## Safety Considerations

### Common
- Genital mycotic infections (5-10%)
- Urinary tract infections (modest increase)
- Volume depletion (especially elderly)

### Rare but Serious
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (euglycemic)
  * Risk factors: Surgery, fasting, illness
  * Management: Hold during acute illness
- Fournier's gangrene (very rare)

### Monitoring
- Renal function at baseline and periodically
- Volume status in elderly/diuretic users
- Ketones if symptomatic during illness

## Clinical Recommendations

1. First-line add-on for T2DM with:
   - Established ASCVD
   - Heart failure
   - CKD (eGFR ≥20-25)

2. Consider regardless of HbA1c in high-risk patients

3. Continue even as eGFR declines (cardiorenal benefit persists)

4. Avoid in Type 1 diabetes, recurrent DKA, severe renal impairment
